                                    <p>This term in year 12 Information Technology Systems class has been approached by an educational institute ‘Smithfield Early Learning Centre’. Due to recent studies, a trend has been found which affects the way children learn and play due to the impact of smartphones and tablets as statistics also show the continued rise of smartphone and tablet usage especially by children and the increased rate of apps developed for such devices. Following the trend ‘Smithfield Early Learning Centre’ has requested an application to be developed that can be employed on to smartphones and tablets, providing a digital educational platform acting as an educational tool for children around the age of 2 – 5. Design of the application should suit a variety of smartphones and tablets, while providing the necessary learning methods for a diverse range of children and either covering a wide variety of learning areas or a deep focus around one of the areas. Aesthetics design of the application will need to attract the attention of young children, further research will need to be conducted to determine the best solution to attract children and engage them in learning activities.</p>

Due to its languishing sales as a result of an influx of other energy drink brands. Although ‘bnatural’ mas maintained a steady place hold in the market of energy drinks, the number of drink sales will necessarily need to improve in order for ‘bnatural’ to become a competitor in the flooded market of energy drink products. The client has decided to overhaul and improve the design of the can, allowing the product to uniquely standout. Directed especially at the young individuals, the product will need to capture the ‘Youth Culture’ though an attractive and unique design. Research will be required in order to capture the theme to meet the client requirements.</p>
